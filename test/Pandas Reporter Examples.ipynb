    "# Using Pandas Reporter for Analyzing The ACS\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll use Census Reporter and pandasreporter to combine age groups in a census table and report aggregates and ratios. To keep the extent of the data small, we'll analyze COunty subdivisions of Bexar County Texas. \n",
    "\n",
    "To start the anslysis, visit [Census Reporter](https://censusreporter.org) and search for \"Bexar\" in the \"Profile\" search box. Select \"Bexar County, Texas\". On the profile page, in the 'Find data for this place' search box, search for \"Poverty Status by Sex By Age.\" You should get a hit for Table B17001, \"Poverty Status in the Past 12 Months by Sex by Age\"\n",
    "\n",
    "On the data page for [Table B17001](https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B17001&geo_ids=05000US48029&primary_geo_id=05000US48029) select, in the left margin, under \"Divide Bexar County, TX into \" the link for \"county subdivisions\". You'll end up at [a page with columns for each of the county subdivisions](https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B17001&geo_ids=05000US48029,060|05000US48029&primary_geo_id=05000US48029)\n",
    "\n",
    "Look in the URL bar, and you'll see at the end of the url, these URL quiery parameters:  `geo_ids=05000US48029,060` and `primary_geo_id=05000US48029`. The `primary_geo_id` is the geoid for Bexar County, Tx. You can also get this value from the profile page. For instance the profile page for the Cit of San Diego has the URL https://censusreporter.org/profiles/16000US0666000-san-diego-ca/, where `16000US0666000` is the geoid for San Diego. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `,060` part of `geoids` is the summary level for the county subdivisions. You can also get the summar level code [from this list](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/summary_level.html). Furthermore, the first three digits of any geoid is the summar levels, so for the place San Diego, with geoid `16000US0666000`, the summary level code is `160`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now you have everything you need to fetch a table with the Census Reporter API: we need the table id, the geoid of the containing geography, and the summary level code for the divisons of the containing geography.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Table: `B17001` ( Poverty Status in the Past 12 Months by Sex by Age )\n",
    "* Containing geography geoid: `05000US48029` ( Bexar County,  Tx )\n",
    "* Summary level: `060` ( County Subdivisions )\n",
